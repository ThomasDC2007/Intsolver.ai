# AI Integral Solver

AI Integral Solver is a web-based tool designed to help students and professionals solve basic integrals step by step. Users can input an integral, and the AI will provide a structured solution, displaying the necessary formulas and calculations along the way.

## Features
- **Step-by-step solutions** for basic integrals
- **Formula names** used at each step
- **Supports elementary functions** like polynomials, sine, cosine, exponential, and logarithmic functions
- **User-friendly calculator interface**

## How It Works
1. Enter an integral in the calculator input bar (e.g., `âˆ« x^2 dx`).
2. The AI processes the input and applies the relevant integration rules.
3. A step-by-step solution is displayed, showing calculations and formula names.
4. The final result is presented clearly for verification.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React for UI if applicable)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- **AI/ML Model:** TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable) or symbolic computation with SymPy
- **Math Rendering:** MathJax or KaTeX for clear mathematical expressions

## Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
